	<h1>TWICE is a multinational K-pop Girl Group formed by JYP Entertainment <br>
	(the same agency as Wonder Girls, Miss A, GOT 7 etc.) <br>
	In 2015 through the reality show Sixteen, where sixteen girls competed against each other <br>
	to decide who would be the ones to debut in a long-planned project of the agency. <br>
	Eventually, nine winners were chosen and became members of the group:
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<center>Jihyo (Leader, main vocalist)<br>
	Nayeon (Lead vocalist)<br>
	Jeongyeon (Lead vocalist)<br>
	Momo (Main dancer, sub-vocalist, sub-rapper)<br>
	Sana (Lead dancer, sub-vocalist)<br>
	Mina (Lead dancer, sub-vocalist)<br>
	Dahyun (Lead rapper, sub-vocalist)<br>
	Chaeyoung (Main rapper, sub-vocalist)<br>
	Tzuyu (Maknae, face of the group, sub-vocalist)<br></center>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Of the members, five of them are Korean (Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Jihyo, Dahyun and Chaeyoung), <br>
	three are Japanese nationality (Momo, Sana, Mina) and one is Taiwanese (Tzuyu).<br>
	<br>
	The group debuted a few months later with the mini-album "The Story Begins" and it was a massive success. <br>
	The title track "Like Ooh-Ahh" broke records for K-pop debuts, and the girls landed numerous endorsements, <br>
	claimed to be enough to maintain JYPE as a company for 10 years. Record-breaking trends continued with their <br>
	second mini-album "Page Two", which also landed the group their first music show wins.<br>
	<br>
	Amidst comebacks, Taiwanese member, Tzuyu, was caught in a political proxy war between China and Taiwan which <br>
	made international news. She got backlash for waiving Taiwan's flag in a Korean Tv Show note , forcing her to make <br>
	a video apology. Reactions to this have been extreme, from (allegedly) influencing the elections in Taiwan in favor of <br>
	the pro-independence party, to the Chinese government censoring searches for the controversy in order to defend her.<br>
