	<h1>During a Weekly Idol appearance, it's revealed that Momo is suffering from a sore throat/flu, <br>
	which sucks, but it does have the silver lining of making her voice sound uproariously hilarious, <br>
	causing the MC's and members to playfully tease her about it. Seriously, get a load of this cute <br>
	Japanese girl who suddenly has the voice of a thirty year chain-smoker and TRY not to laugh.<br>
	<br>
	<h1>In that same episode, Tzuyu, Sana, Momo, and Mina (the non-Korean members) play a game in <br>
	which they have to guess the missing word in a Korean proverb (Cutting _____ with a knife, the <br>
	answer is water, meaning you're doing something useless). When asked for answers, Mina reveals hers: <br>
	"stomach". Everybody reacts with simultaneous laughter and horror...except Momo, who wrote the same thing!<br>
	<br>
	<h1>For Knowing Brothers' music video "Sweet Dreams", Momo has to hit Lee Soo-geun in the head with a pan, <br>
	and does so real well....because she dents the pan. <br>
